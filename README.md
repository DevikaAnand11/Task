Set up MongoDB:

Install MongoDB by following the instructions on the MongoDB website.
Start the MongoDB server.
Configure environment variables:

Create a .env file in the root directory of the project.

Copy code
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your_database_name
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
Replace your_database_name with the name of your MongoDB database and your_secret_key with a secret key for JWT token generation.

Usage
